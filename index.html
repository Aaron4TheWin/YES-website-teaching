  <h2>Data created by Aaron Kingslien, Nathan Morales, James Lu, and Ryan Mendiondo</h2>
  <p>A light wavelength spectrometer measures the reflectance of various wavelengths of light from a surface, providing detailed information about the colors present. When analyzing a green folder, if the folder is not a dark green but rather a lighter or more mixed shade, the spectrometer may show a higher reflectance of cyan. This is because green pigments in such a folder often contain a mixture of blue and yellow components. If the green is not dark and pure, the blue component, which is part of the cyan wavelength range (around 490-520 nm), was more prominent, resulting in higher reflectance in the cyan region.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the perceived color of the folder depends on how the pigments in the material absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light. A lighter green folder reflects more light overall, including wavelengths in the cyan range, compared to a darker green folder that would absorb more light and reflect less. Therefore, the spectrometer detects a higher cyan reflectance, indicating that the green is not purely green but contains significant blue components that contribute to the overall reflectance spectrum. This subtle difference in pigment composition and light reflection can cause the spectrometer to register higher cyan reflectance, suggesting the folder is a lighter or mixed shade of green rather than a deep, pure green.</p>
